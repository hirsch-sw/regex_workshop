# Hello! Welcome to my regex tutorial.

## Guide
The best guide is the powerpoint presentation `regex_SH_20240605.pptx`, which will give you an overview of the topics covered.

## Source data
You'll find [the data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/most-liked-comments-on-youtube) (kindly put together by nipunarora8 on Kaggle) for the workshop in `00_data/youtube_dataset.csv`.

## Examples for practice
`01_code/regex_examples.R` goes through the different practical applications of the techniques mentioned in the presentation.
`01_code/regex_prep.R` is the cleaning code used for the example data, which is in `00_data/comments.csv` and `00_data/comments_wide.csv`.
