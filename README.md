# Hello! Welcome to my regex tutorial.

## Guide
The best guide is the powerpoint presentation regex_SH_20240605, which will give you an overview of the topics covered.

## Source data
In the regex R project branch, you'll find regex_prep, which prepares [the data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/most-liked-comments-on-youtube) (kindly put together by nipunarora8 on Kaggle) for the workshop.

## Examples for practice
There is also regex_examples, which goes through the different practical applications of the techniques mentioned in the presentation.
