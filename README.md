Hello! Welcome to my little regex tutorial.
The best guide is the powerpoint presentation regex_SH_20240605, which will give you an overview of the topics covered.
In the regex R project branch, you'll find regex_prep, which prepares the data [find it here:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nipunarora8/most-liked-comments-on-youtube) for the workshop.
There is also regex_examples, which goes through the different practical applications of the techniques mentioned in the presentation.
